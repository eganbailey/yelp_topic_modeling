# Predicting Useful Yelp Reviews

What makes a useful Yelp review? What characteristics do reviews have that make them more likely to be seen as useful? Do people who write useful reviews tend to be more prolific?

## Goals

The goals of this project are to:

1) predict the usefulness of Yelp reviews as a classification problem
2) quantify usefulness of Yelp reviews on a numeric/percentage scale and predict this 'Usefulness' score as a regression problem
3) apply models trained on Yelp review text on review text from other sites and evaluate their performance

## Technologies Used:

    * **NLP**: Spacy, Textacy, Linear Dirichlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis, non-Negative Matrix Factorization
    
    * **Modeling**: scikit-learn, statsmodels
    
    * **Data Handling** pandas, PostgreSQL
