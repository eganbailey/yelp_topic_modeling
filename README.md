# Predicting Useful Yelp Reviews

What makes a useful Yelp review? What characteristics do reviews have that make them more likely to be seen as useful? Do people who write useful reviews tend to be more prolific?

## Goals

The goals of this project are to 1) predict the usefulness of reviews on Yelp and 2) to predict the usefulness of individual users' reviews based on their review history.
