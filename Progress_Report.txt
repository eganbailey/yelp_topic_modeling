- Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?

  Data is acquired and located on the PostgreSQL server. I have a text file of alternate reviews (for Amazon products) stored locally.
  
- Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?

  I've done EDA on the Yelp reviews and will probably add some visualizations in the future. I plan on doing EDA on the secondary datasets (users, Amazon) once my primary modeling step is in a good state.
  
- Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?

  I've setup a pipeline for clustering to obtain features for my predictive models and collected topics for my reviews. I plan on completing the predictive modeling step by the end of the week.
  
- What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?

  I've already dealt with many of these issues (mainly the large amount of RAM needed to hold the large text corpora in memory). I may test another NLP module with built-in sentiment modules in conjunction with my topic modeling results.

- What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?

Have classification/regression models for usefulness for the Yelp reviews done by end of this week. Begin EDA/Viz on secondary datasets on weekend.

Process and evaluate models on secondary goals in Week 12.
