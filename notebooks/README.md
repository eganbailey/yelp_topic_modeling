This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for this project that encompass exploratory data analysis, text processing, topic modeling, and model training and evaluation. The notebooks are numerically labeled to be followed in sequence beginning with [Notebook 1](https://github.com/gd32/DSI_capstone/blob/master/notebooks/01_EDA_Reviews.ipynb).

**Warning:** Running the notebooks from start to finish will require an excess of 32 GB RAM and at least 45 GB of free drive space; it therefore not advised that cells be run to completion.
